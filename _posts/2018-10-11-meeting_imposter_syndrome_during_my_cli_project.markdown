This week I finally completed my month and a half journey to completing my CLI project. Yes, a month and a half! This project made me grow as a software developer in training but also brought to light some very deep issues of imposter syndrome that I was feeling. 

Prior to this project, my hand was held through completing all of the required labs. This was the first time where we were given a blank canvas and had to apply everything that we've learned thus far. As a person who hates the feeling of losing or struggling with a concept, being lost at times felt intimidating. Some days I felt that I wasn't cut out for a future in software development. I hesitated to reach out for help because in showing weakness, I was afraid that the instructors would come to the same conclusion about my potential as a software developer. 

Reflecting on the last few months, I'm thankful that this feeling hit me so hard during the early stages of my journey to being a software developer. This project not only helped me grow as a programmer, but as a person by teaching me an essential lesson before entering a male-dominated tech world. 

One day, I reached out to my good friend who is a senior developer for GitHub and former senior developer at Atom. I told her about how I was reacting to imposter syndrome by not seeking help or moving through my project at a reasonable pace. She asked me to come to the GitHub headquarters to meet her coworkers. We spent the day working indvidually on our work. I was able to see her get stuck on problems for hours at a time. She coincidently created many of the features that I used for this program herself. She shared stories about how she mishaps that happened while she was programming these features. 

At the end of our day together, she left me with a piece of advice that resonated with me: She told be to look around the room to everyone at the GitHub headquarters. She said that "I'm a veteran programmer, and you saw me struggling with my code until I figured the solution out. The secret to imposter syndrome is that everyone feels it and it never goes away. If you look around this room, there are people from all different walks of life and educational training. Everyone experiences it everyday. The trick it that you fake it until you make it because one day it what you're struggling with will come to you easier."

At that moment, I decided that I wasn not going to let imposter syndrome scare me away from living my dreams.
