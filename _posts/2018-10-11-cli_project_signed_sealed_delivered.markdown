Completing my CLI project was a journey! 

A little about my project. It's a CLI API gem project that used an open source API called Lyrics.OVH to retrieve the lyrics to songs. Because I'm such a huge Beatles fan, I thought to would be fun to create a list of top 10 Beatles songs and have the user pick which song they would like lyrics for. 

The biggest technical skill that I learned from this project was how to use an API. A problem that I ran into while making requests from my program was that I kept getting an invalid URI message. I found out that I needed to format my request to the API service using the URI gem. 

I learned the importance of gem and how easier life can be with them! In my project, I wanted to make the error codes red so I found another gem called "colorize" that makes it possible to add color to CLI text. 

Another concept that I became more familiar with was the structure of a program. After using the blunder gem, I was able to see what the skeleton of a program looks like. After programming my very own program, I have a much better understanding of the purpose of each part of a gem. 

After learning these new skills and solidifying concepts, I'm even more excited for what projects are to come during my time at Flatiron!
