As the saying goes, life’s journey is not a straight path. My life’s journey can attest this simple life truth. I was first introduced to the tech world in the most unlikeliest of places, in total isolation while sailing in the middle of the Indian Ocean. While living and working on a floating university called Semester at Sea, I was introduced to some of the greatest minds of tech. When former VP of Google Megan Smith joined our voyage and spoke about her vision of tech, I knew that my life’s journey was going to change. When I returned home, I left my dream of becoming a history professor in the past and set on a future in tech. 

I named this blog after the first woman in Aztec mythology, Oxomoco. Tor me she symbolizes what it means to be a woman in tech. Many women enter tech as the first in their families or communities to be a software developer. The experience of a woman in tech has its own special challenges in a male-dominated tech culture and at times can feel lonely.

This blog will document my learning progression through the Flatiron School Web Development program. I hope that by writing about my journey, I can help other Oxomo women embark on their own journey into the big world of tech. 


Signed,

A very determined Oxomo woman
