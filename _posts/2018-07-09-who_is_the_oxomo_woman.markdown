I am a native Bay Area girl born into center of the tech universe. Although I've always heard of the .com boom, I've never understood what "tech" really was. It wasn't until I sailed around the world on a floating university called Semester at Sea that I first understood what tech is. When I had a glimpse of a humanitarian movement happening within tech, I knew that I needed to be a part of it. After that trip, I left my aspirations to be a history professor in the past and looked forward to a future in tech. 

I grew up in a community that had predistinguished expectations of me as  a Latina: grow up, find a nice hard-working man to marry, have lots of kids, and keep my house in order. Although I felt these pressures, I was lucky enough to be born into a family of strong women. Like momma Nia in My Big Fat Greek Wedding says, “The man may be the head of the household. But the woman is the neck, and she can turn the head whichever way she pleases.” 

This is the narrative of many Latinas in higher education like myself who have had to overcome gender expectations in our community. Many of us have learned how to redirect our strong characteristics into challenging the very social structure that made us who we are. I believe that because of the innate characteristics within Latina women, we may serve the tech community in a special way.

So who is the Oxomo Woman? Oxomo (also known as Oxomoco) in the Aztec religion was the first woman to be created. Oxomo had to define her own identity as a woman and navigate the word on her own terms, paving the way for others who came after her. The Oxomo Woman is ALL women who are pursuing a career in a male dominated tech world. Many of us our first or one of a small number of female software engineers in a conference room, team, start-up, or meetup. We all have something special in common: we are paving the way for a new generation of women from our home communities to enter tech. 

Take a deep breath. Stay calm, code on. We aren't here with pitchforks looking to take down the man. We simply want to offer a new perspective. 

This blog will be about my experience in the Flatiron Online Web Development program as well as various topics in programming. Let this crazy, long, and adventurous journey begin! 

Signed,

A very excited Oxomo woman
